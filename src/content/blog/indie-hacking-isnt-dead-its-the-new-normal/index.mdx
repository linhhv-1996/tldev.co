> “Indie hacking” isn’t dead; it matured into the default way to build. That raises the bar: better products, stronger distribution, and faster iteration. In AI, technical moats are thin, churn is high, and GPU/API costs squeeze margins—so the pragmatic play is **sell first → do it manually → automate later**, use a stack you ship fast with, let **SEO + TikTok/creators** pull demand, and wrap your infra so you can **swap providers** quickly. Surf the short-term waves while cultivating a **Lindy** asset for stability.

#### Pieter Levels: Indie hacking isn’t dead — it’s the new normal

“**Indie hacking is dead.**” Pieter Levels tweeted that once, and most people stopped at the first line. What he meant: indie hacking grew up. It moved from a scrappy subculture to **the default path** many founders take. When something becomes normal, competition thickens, expectations rise, and Big Tech starts **copying features fast**. The game shifts from clever hacks to **disciplined product and distribution**.

#### When “hacking” becomes the norm

Back in 2014–2016, indie hacking was still novel. By 2023+, it’s mainstream enough that **larger teams watch indie makers** for ideas. User expectations climbed with it: smooth UX, solid social proof, and real distribution. Winning as an indie isn’t about obscure tech tricks; it’s about **learning, shipping, and iterating faster** than everyone else.

#### The AI era: thin moats, hard retention, rising costs

Most AI startups sit on the same foundations: LLMs like GPT, image models like Stable Diffusion, and similar training/inference APIs. That makes **moats very thin**—a smart competitor can rebuild what you did in a few months. **Retention is tough** because many users just “try and leave.” Meanwhile, **GPU and platform costs are volatile**, which quickly compresses margins. Pieter recalls a provider bumping fine-tuning from \$3 to \$20 per run right when revenue spiked. The lesson is simple: **don’t bet your model on prices going down**; design so you **survive even when they go up**.

#### Pieter’s process: sell first, manual first, then automate

Pieter’s approach is deliberately unromantic. Launch a minimal page, **take real payments**, and **do the work by hand** before writing systems. For AvatarAI, early orders were fulfilled manually through the night. Only after the workflow and demand were clear did he **automate the backbone** within a week. This “concierge first” stance answers two critical questions at once: **will anyone pay**, and **what steps actually create value**.

#### Technology: pragmatic, Lindy, and anti–over-engineering

Pieter refuses to “worship” stacks. PHP/jQuery, modern JS—use **whatever makes you ship and fix fast**. Repeat work a number of times, **then** abstract; avoid early elegance that slows learning. That’s the **Lindy** spirit: tech that’s survived reality is often the most useful. Pragmatic doesn’t mean sloppy—keep code structured so others can take over and modules can be swapped without drama.

#### Distribution is the moat: SEO and creators beat press

Media logos are nice; **customers come from SEO and creators**. One creator video took MRR from \$12k to \$40–50k and kept it elevated. Package your problem–solution in the **language of search** (pages for money keywords) and the **formats algorithms prefer** (short, curiosity-driven clips). The best social proof is **real metrics, real customer outcomes, and real workflows**—not a glossy press kit.

#### De-risking platform dependencies

AI startups stack dependencies: GPUs, model vendors, APIs, infrastructure. Defense looks boring but saves companies: **abstract your model/provider layer**, write adapters so you can **switch quickly**, and **multi-source** GPU/compute. Track price and performance like business KPIs, not mere technical details. Guarding **gross margin** belongs right next to building features.

#### X/Twitter has new rules: long-form, sharp hooks, watch time

The algorithm now favors **watch time** and early engagement signals. That opens the door for **long-form posts** on X—but only if you lead with a **tight 1–2 sentence hook** that earns the first few seconds. Pieter still “says it straight,” but he **formats for the platform**. If you build in public, think like an **editor**: one message, many formats.

#### Cycles and balance: ride waves, plant Lindy assets

Economies and cultures move in cycles; AI is the current wave. Pieter leaned in—trading stability for speed and pressure. On the other side, **Nomad List** shows the value of **Lindy assets**: low cost, steady revenue, slow-and-sure improvements. The practical equilibrium is to **surf waves for upside** while **growing something durable** to anchor your time and mind.

#### A practical path for indie devs today

Start with **a painful, wallet-attached problem** you can observe in subreddits, TikTok, and niche communities. Don’t build a system—**fake the door** with a landing page, payment, and a form. Fulfill the first dozen orders **by hand** to learn the real workflow. When a common pattern emerges, **automate the spine** and keep a few steps manual to keep learning. In parallel, build **search-intent pages** and **short demos** (before/after, real outcomes). Always measure **unit costs** (GPU/API per task), **gross margin**, and **churn/retention**; adjust pricing and packaging to actual usage frequency. And set a **work–rest cadence** so you don’t burn out chasing model releases.

#### Conclusion

Indie hacking didn’t die—it **graduated**. Today, the edge comes from **how fast you learn and ship**, **how well you distribute**, **how little you depend on any single platform**, and **how honestly you tell the product’s story**. Sell first, do it manually, automate later, then optimize. **Surf to go fast; plant to go far.**
